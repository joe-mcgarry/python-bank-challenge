# Bank Tech Test, Python edition

This is a tech challenge based on [this](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/individual_challenges/bank_tech_test.md), built in Python.  

## Run the program

## Testing
Testing is carried out using Pytest

## Requirements
- You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or Node. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Example input-output
```
date || credit || debit || balance 
14/01/2023 || || 500.00 || 2500.00 
13/01/2023 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00 
10/01/2023 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
